My name is Robert Ward, I'm a software developer living in St. Louis.

I'm the co-founder of the hackerspace [Arch Reactor](https://archreactor.org/) and the software company [Juristat](https://www.juristat.com/).  I also co-organize -- and regularly speak at -- the local [2600 Meeting](https://www.meetup.com/st-louis-2600/) hosted at Arch Reactor on the first friday of each month.
